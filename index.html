            <h2>About me</h2><p>       
My career goals are mainly to work in software development. I am currently a computer science major so I would say that my current degree field is working towards that goal. I am not interested in working in academia and the right startup opportunity could be enticing. The things I’m really looking for are financial security and a location I would enjoy. My goal post college is to find a job in Seattle preferably, but I would also be fine with Portland or San Fransico. I lived in Olympia, Washington for a period of around 9 months and have always wanted to move back. I would be fine with a role outside of software development if it meant living in these areas since I can always move roles and company’s later on in my career.
